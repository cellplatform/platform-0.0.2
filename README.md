[Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) comprising the core set of shared `system` modules that flexibly compose into varying arrangements of   
(1) extremely-late-bound, (2) strongly typed, (3) decentralised, "cell like" functional processes.

Sustained long range R&D.  
Architecture, API's, and other conceptual primmitives will change (probably radically üê∑) prior to any `1.x` release.

[Doug McIlroy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy) as quoted by [Salus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_H._Salus) in "[A Quarter Century of Unix](https://www.google.co.nz/books/edition/_/ULBQAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)" ([ref](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs/)):

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[Doug McIlroy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy) 4-point formulation of the [Unix Philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html):

1. **Make each program do one thing well.**  
   To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

2. **Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.**  
   Don‚Äôt clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don‚Äôt insist on interactive input.

3. **Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks.**  
   Don‚Äôt hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

4. **Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task**,  
   Even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you‚Äôve finished using them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Subjective Measures of Quality (Design / System Engineering):

- [Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity)
- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
- Good [Seperation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
- Good lines of [Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science))  ([information hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding))
- [Loose Coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)

<p>&nbsp;</p>


>> **"libraries not frameworks"**  
>> Orient toward framework agnosticism (by default).

# Development

[![ci(esm)](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.2.0/actions/workflows/node.esm.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.2.0/actions/workflows/node.esm.yml)

### Primary Global Commands (All Modules)

The following global commands run from the root of the project and operate on all nested
sub-modules of the system within this [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).

These commands constitute the primary CI (continuous integration) pipeline.
See [github action](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.2.0/actions/workflows/node.esm.yml)
which protects the `main` branch when merging in PRs (pull-requests). 
A security audit on the up-stream dependencies is performed on each CI cycle.


```bash

$ yarn audit
$ yarn build
$ yarn test

```

To run all of these locally within a single command:
```bash
$ yarn ci
```

To see the layout of the module namespace, and related meta-data, run the `list` command:
```bash
$ yarn ls         <= Sorted alphabetically
$ yarn ls --topo  <= Topologically sorted on the module dependency graph (depth-first)
                        
```

The topologically sorted option (`--topo`) shows the build order used when running the compiler over each module (global `yarn build`).

Here the usage of the term "compiler" flexibly maps to any kind of code transpiling activity, from module bundling through to binary compilation (eg, rust/wasm).


![cmd:ls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/185555/192442837-debd2c41-b1e8-4c1a-a4d6-1dcbf83173fd.png)





<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Note:** the system currently uses [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) for build-chain bootstrapping only. Once the Typescript compiler 
and ESM module bundler is bootstrapped into existence, the dependency on `node.js` falls away, or put another way, `node.js` is not a 
primary dependency.  

In particular a loose coupling is strongly retained around any one  "user interface rendering library" as distinct to pure functional "logic" libraries, as UI tends towards the most valatility in an architecutre over time.  Any form of "interface" (the `I` in `API`) tends toward messiness and complex noise - the one involving "humans" is especially prone.   

Organizing for this is expressed within the distinct `/system/` and `/system.ui/` root folder structure (and the `system.ui` sub-folder structure isolating and nameing each core UI rendering technology of the libraries contained within: `<platform-name>.<library-name>`, eg 

- system.ui/web.react/`<libname>/`
- system.ui/web.svelte/`<libname>/`


#### Evolution Strategy

This is a general theme of the system, to think of commitments to technology choices in as abstract and forward looking way possible.
Obviously to pragamaitcally achieve anything, committments to certain technologies do need to be made in any given moment.  But careful, and sustained
attention while making these kinds of calls can also ensure the long run-ramp, where the "idea" itself remains consistent, but the implementation
choices can be swapped out and evolved over time.  This is the ideal at least; `AND` "reality is a bitch!"  Evolution is messy, yet we also find spontaneosly emerging self-cleaning, self-maintaing ecosystem in nature - so this is a feature of reality that can be coaxed (encouraged) into stable existence.

### Licence Analysis

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B8499%2Fgithub.com%2Fcellplatform%2Fplatform-0.2.0.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B8499%2Fgithub.com%2Fcellplatform%2Fplatform-0.2.0?ref=badge_shield)
[![license: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The system (platform) lives as an "open commons" shared resource of the world's peoples. As such the core modules of the system are [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS) and all up-stream dependencies conform with transitively equivalent OSS licences.

In the case of this repo the baseline is the [MIT Licence](LICENSE), and when evolving the licencing strategy through reearched refinement over time, will move toward the attractor of "more free" as in "individual freedoms" ([libre](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libre)) free.

To run a "licence analysis" and validate the module depenency graph against this principle run:

```bash
$ fossa analyze
```
