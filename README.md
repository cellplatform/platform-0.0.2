# Philosophy

As quoted on [@isaacs](https://www.npmjs.com/~isaacs) post ["Unix Philosophy and Node.js"](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs),  
[Doug McIlroy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy) 4-point formulation of the [Unix Philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html):

<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. **Make each program do one thing well.**  
   To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

2. **Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.**  
   Don‚Äôt clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don‚Äôt insist on interactive input.

3. **Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks.**  
   Don‚Äôt hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

4. **Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task**,  
   even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you‚Äôve finished using them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[@isaacs](https://www.npmjs.com/~isaacs) variations on the theme [distilled to](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs):

- **Working** is better than perfect.
- **Focus** is better than features.
- **Compatibility** is better than purity.
- **Simplicity** is better than anything.

# Development

[![ci](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.0.2/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.0.2/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

The following global commands run from the root of the project and operate on all nested sub-modules of the system within this [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).

These commands also approximate the main [CI](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.0.2/actions/workflows/node.js.yml) behavior covered in this [github action steps](https://github.com/cellplatform/platform-0.0.2/actions/workflows/node.js.yml) when merging a PR into the [`main`](/tree/main) branch.

```bash

yarn
yarn build
yarn test

```

### Licence Analysis

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B8499%2Fgithub.com%2Fcellplatform%2Fplatform-0.0.2.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B8499%2Fgithub.com%2Fcellplatform%2Fplatform-0.0.2?ref=badge_shield)
[![license: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The system (platform) lives as an "open commons" shared resource of the world. As such the core modules are [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS) and all up-stream dependencies conform with transitively equivalent OSS licences.  
In the case of this repo the baseline is the [MIT Licence](LICENSE).

To run a "licence analysis" and validate the depenency graph against this principle run:

      $ fossa analyze
