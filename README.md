# Philosophy

As quoted on [@isaacs](https://www.npmjs.com/~isaacs) post ["Unix Philosophy and Node.js"](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs),  
[Doug McIlroy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy) 4-point formulation of the [Unix Philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html):

<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. **Make each program do one thing well.**  
   To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

2. **Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.**  
   Don‚Äôt clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don‚Äôt insist on interactive input.

3. **Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks.**  
   Don‚Äôt hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

4. **Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task**,  
   even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you‚Äôve finished using them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[@isaacs](https://www.npmjs.com/~isaacs) follows this up with a thoughtful translation into [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) terms. His [whole post](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs) is worth the read, but here's a distillation:

- **Working** is better than perfect.
- **Focus** is better than features.
- **Compatibility** is better than purity.
- **Simplicity** is better than anything.

# Development

### Development Machine Setup

Development machine [environment install/setup](docs/setup.environment.md) suggestions.

### Licence Analysis

The system/platform is an "open commons" shared resource for the world. As such it is "[open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)" (OSS) and all dependencies must conform with amenable OSS licences as well, in the case of this repo baseline is the [MIT Licence](LICENSE). To run an analysis over the depenency graph run:

      $ fossa analyze

(see [fossa](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/importing-a-project) configuration docs)

[MIT](LICENSE) all the way!
